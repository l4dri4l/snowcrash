First we execute level08 binary:

    ./level08 [file to read]

So we executed it with token as parameter :

    You may not access 'token'

Well... We noticed the sticky bit on the executable. We tried on different files and it worked.
By using command `strings level08` and `nm level08` we saw `token` in clear and that `strstr` was used.

So we thought that the program checks if the file is named `token`.

We created a symlink to counter this :
ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/coucou

And then
./level08 /tmp/coucou

gives us the content of token -> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

It's the password to login as flag08 !
