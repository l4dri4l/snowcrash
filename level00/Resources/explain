After searching a few minutes we typed
    `ls -lRa / 2>/dev/null | less`

We found a text file named `john` in `/usr/sbin` (and in other directories but they are the same)

`cat /usr/sbin/john` -> cdiiddwpgswtgt

Tried with John, didn't work.
Tried on www.dcode.fr/chiffre-cesar with option "try all" checked.

In the list the string `nottoohardhere` clearly shows up.

`su flag00`, using `nottoohardhere` as password unlocks us the first flag ;)
