First, to make things easier, we downloaded the .pcap file via `scp`.

Then we openened it with Wireshark to analyse the file.

By reading every paquet we noticed a `Password:` in one of them.
Next paquets sent (and not received) contained a data field for every key pressed on the keyboard.

It gives us this sequence :

ft_wandr<<<NDRel<L0L

< means hexadecimal 7F here, which is a carriage return. By applying then we get :

ft_waNDReL0L, which is the password for flag02 user !
