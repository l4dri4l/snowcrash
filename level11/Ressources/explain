A lua source file is present in the home. It has a setuid flag so it runs with flag11 permissions. When we run it it stops because it fails to open a socket on port 5151 as it is already in use. 
In the source code the string passed as argument is compared to another string that resembles a hash. When bruteforce the hash (crackstation.net), we get the string "NotSoEasy", that is useless -> it's a troll...
We can assume the program already runs, so we connect to it using `nc 127.0.0.1 5151`. It asks for a password, but we can see in the source code that the arg is hashed using a call to io.popen() with echo | shasum. So we can give it "coucou; getflag > /tmp/flag". The command is run with flag11 permissions and the file is created. We get the password for flag11 fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
