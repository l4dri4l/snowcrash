Executing `level06` gives us an error, this error basically tells us that it runs level06.php (readable).

level06.php uses `preg_replace`, we found that using this function with its /e modifier has a vulnerability.
This enables us to execute some php !

Reverse engineering the regex tells us to put our php code into a special pattern:
[x code_here]

To be able to execute code within quotes we use `{}` notation:
[x {${shell_exec($z)}}]

- Here we execute command given in the second argument ($z).

We put our malicious code into `/tmp/virus`

Finally by running `./level06 /tmp/virus getflag` we get our flag !
