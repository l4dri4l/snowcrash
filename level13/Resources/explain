level13 binary only gives the flag if we have GUID 4242.

There's two methods to break trough this. First we can create a false `getuid` library and LD_PRELOAD it before running the program :

    gcc adrien.c -shared -o virus.so
    LD_PRELOAD=virus.so level13

or, with ghidra, we can get the full clear code of the program.
In the main we see :
    
    ft_des("boe]!ai0FB@.:|L6l@A?>qJ}I");

We can also see the code a `ft_des`. I made a .c file containing the decrypt function and the main running it.

    gcc hugo.c
    ./a.out -> gives a hash

The given hash is the password for level14
